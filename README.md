## This repo is all about curiously testing bun as runtime, bundler and package manager.

### Bun as a runtime

bun is a drop in replacement for node as a runtime, but why one should use bun instead of node the simple answer is speed (as far as i am considered) bun implements all the API's of node so you can use bun from day 1 without compromising anything.

write a server side script and then run it with bun index.js instead of node.index.js

### Bun as a bundler

When we are working with web we often need bundler mostly we have worked with webpack till date but now bun replaces webpack why??? speed!! 

write the javascript files and then bundle with the following command bun build boom!

### Bun as a package manager

Bun is also a package manager replacing npm and works for all the packages present the npm registry again speed is the reason one can opt for bun as a package manager
